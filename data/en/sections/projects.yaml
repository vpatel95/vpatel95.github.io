      repo: "https://github.com/vpatel95/tcp_eyenet"
      summary: "A TCP Congestion Control mechanism which utilizes a hybrid model of delay-based and loss-based congestion control. Eyenet can switch between different mode of controls based on the current network conditions. Under high latency links delay based congestion control performs very poorly as compared to traditional algorithms. In such cases Eyenet switched back to loss based algorithms."
